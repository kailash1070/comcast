# comcast

Contains the work which I have done as part of AAMP open source player in comcast for both HLS and DASH technology.

Name: Kailash Baskar ( kbaska201 ) 
email id: kailash_baskar@comcast.com - when I was working for comcast.

Code repo link: https://code.rdkcentral.com/r/plugins/gitiles/rdk/components/generic/aamp/

Branches in which I mainly worked on: dev_sprint, dev_sprint_21_1 (development branches, when they are validated the code is moved to stable and release branches)

One example of my feature development work is integrating the thumbnail scrubbing feature during FF or RW on IP player.

Mainly worked on C, C++ and some Java Script to develop IP player features on linux environment.
